## Functional Data Analysis (FDA)
FDA refers to the branch of statistics that is focuses on studying curve data. Functional data is all around us, you may think of weather data for your city, handwriting, financial data or growth curves for children... One thing all these data have in  commun is that they make sense when you look at the entire curve rather than isolated points.
