## The experiment

In this experiment* the engineer is trying to find an improved battery design to give longer life. The only design parameter that they are interested in is plate material for the battery, however from past experience it is known that temperature at which the battery is exposed will probably affect the effective battery life.
A 2-factors factorial experiment is ran: plate material type (Material) and lab temperature (Temperature) each of which is varied over 3 levels, the battery life ( Life )  is recorded.
