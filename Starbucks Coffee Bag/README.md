The goal of this experiment is to fine tune the sealing process of the Starbucks coffee bag. After conducting a screening design vital factors (Pressure|Plate gape|Viscosity) were investigated factors to study two conflicting outcomes, Tear and Leakage.

To find the process settings minimizing both the outcomes, Response Surface Models were fit to model each response and Desirability Function was used to find a compromise solution.

Bellow is displayed the consensus region where the specification limits are met for both outcomes.
