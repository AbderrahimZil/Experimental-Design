# Experimental-Design

"If you need to collect data to figure out the answer to your questions, and you're not using designed experiments to do that; you are leaving money on the table and possibly making stupid decisions". This is how Dr. Douglas C. Montgomery concluded his overview on the Experimental Design Specialization hosted on coursera.

In this project, we tried to give a holistic approach to carry out designed experiments and their analysis using free & open source packages. The data used are famous use-cases from the industry and the analysis in done using R programming language.

In this project we seek to highlight the importance of DOE and the power of open source.
